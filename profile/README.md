### :heart: Welcome to the DataTools4Heart (DT4H) Organization :bangbang:

This organization hosts the source code and documentation for all components that power the [DataTools4Heart](https://datatools4heart.eu/) (DT4H) platform — a federated,
privacy-preserving *cardiology data toolbox* developed to enhance health data reusability.
 Our platform enables secure, decentralized analysis of cardiology data while strictly adhering to ethical, legal, and data protection standards.

#### Licensing

All components are **open-source** and governed by specific licenses. Please refer to each repository for detailed licensing information.

#### Core Components

Below are the core components driving the DT4H platform. They primarily fall under two categories:

- **Federated platform components** for privacy-preserving data management and analytics ([repositories list](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adt4h-platform-module+org%3ADataTools4Heart+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)).

- **Data Toolbox components**, offering tools and pipelines for data ingestion, harmonization and federated learning ([repositories list](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adt4h-toolbox-component+org%3ADataTools4Heart+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories)).

*Note: The consortium is actively developing these repositories. Each component may be at a different stage of maturity, so please refer to the documentation carefully before use.*
